Deployment #51 - Fixed SWA Action Parameters
Timestamp: 2025-01-31

KEY FIX:
Corrected Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1 parameters:
- Removed `output_location: "."` (was confusing SWA)
- Added explicit `config_file_location: "dist/staticwebapp.config.json"`
- Kept `app_location: "dist"` (clean and clear)
- Kept `skip_app_build: true`

WHY THIS MATTERS:
The previous workflow had `output_location: "."` which may have signaled to SWA that build artifacts were at root, conflicting with `app_location: "dist"`. This could explain why SWA's validation still showed `App Directory Location: '/' was found`.

The corrected parameters now:
✓ Tell SWA: "Serve from dist/"
✓ Tell SWA: "Find config at dist/staticwebapp.config.json"
✓ Skip any Oryx rebuild
✓ Directly deploy dist contents

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST AFTER DEPLOY:
1. Browser console: Should show NO MIME errors
2. View source: Should show /assets/index-*.js (not /src/main.jsx)
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to clear browser cache
4. Check https://tabarnam.com/api/ping works (returns JSON)
5. Check staging URL: https://thankful-mushroom-0000a931e.2.azurestaticapps.net

If MIME error persists:
- Clear browser cache completely (DevTools → Storage → Clear site data)
- Check CDN cache (may need 5-10 mins for propagation)
- Verify index.html is NOT in git root
