Deployment #48 - MIME type fix
Timestamp: 2025-01-31

FIX APPLIED:
- Workflow now removes root index.html and staticwebapp.config.json before deployment
- This ensures Azure SWA only detects the app in dist/ folder
- Root staticwebapp.config.json removed from repository
- dist/staticwebapp.config.json has correct MIME headers for JavaScript modules

EXPECTED RESULT:
- SWA will deploy from dist/ folder (not root)
- dist/index.html (built version) will be served
- JavaScript modules will have correct application/javascript MIME type
- No more "application/octet-stream" errors
